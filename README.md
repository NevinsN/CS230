Operating Platforms
<br/><br/>
-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
<br/><br/>
Our client, The Gaming Room, develops games, and in particular the game Draw It or Lose It. They are seeking software that will allow their current game to be expanded onto other platforms and to be grown and scaled as the game development progresses. 
<br/><br/>
-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
<br/><br/>
I found that suggesting operating systems through comparison and contrast was my strongest point in this particular document. It played into my existing knowledge and was comfortable, familiar ground.
<br/><br/>
-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
<br/><br/>
I think, particularly, I enjoy that working through the document helped to see where we had been, what had been decided, and what still needed to be sorted out. It lended the project a structure that helped to inform development and make the progress smoother.
<br/><br/>
-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
<br/><br/>
I think if I could approach the recommendations section again, I could improve it. I think I did okay, but my knowledge base could be deeper. I could provide much better and more thorough recommendation with further reading and thought.
<br/><br/>
-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
<br/><br/>
The user's needs are everything. Without the user, you effectively have no software and no product. Users are our lifeblood, and you have to think carefully on how the user interacts with and experiences the software. The REST exercise, where we put in roles, is one examplem that comes to mind. It helps to limit user power to only what they need. Therefore, the average user experiences a streamlined service with only the best bits, the game, to worry about.
<br/><br/>
-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
<br/><br/>
Software should always be approached with modularity in mind. Developing short segments that come together into a greater whole is one of the most effective ways to code, and object oriented development ensures that the framework is in place to accomplish that. Understanding the client needs and what the user has to experience, though, is a fantastic way to begin formulating and sketching a program, and it's a method I plan to use on every project I am working on.
